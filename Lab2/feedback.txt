-7 Your code infinite loops if there is no END in the file. It also infinite loops if there is no ; after a statement.

-4 There are some circumstance where your error recovery does not seem to work.

You left a bunch of commented out code in your file. A better solution is to commit the previous version to git, then delete the commented out code. You can recover it from git if you want to go back to it.

-4 You used the indented code style instead of the flat style I suggested. Some of your 'else's were missing and as a result, some errors were not reported.
